## Supported Operating Systems

## Requirements

* The OS is already running a kernel that supports ZFS.

## Quick Start

### Use From Playbook

1. Create `requirements.yml` in ansible project root, and add this content:

   ```yaml
   # requirements.yml
   - src: https://github.com/digimokan/ans_role_config_zfs_hw
   ```

2. From the project root directory, install/download the role:

   ```shell
   $ ansible-galaxy install --role-file requirements.yml --roles-path ./roles --force-with-deps
   ```

   * _NOTE:_ `--force-with-deps` _ensures subsequent calls download updates_

3. Include the role like any local role, from the project playbook:

   ```yaml
   # playbook.yml
   - hosts: localhost
     connection: local
     tasks:
       - name: "Install and configure ZFS hardware: disks, pools, vdevs, and devices"
         ansible.builtin.include_role:
           name: ans_role_config_zfs_hw
   ```

## Role Options

Vars with default values, which can be overridden in the playbook:

  * [overridable](../defaults/main/overridable)

Vars defined by this role, exported with `public: true`, for use in other roles:

  * [export](../defaults/main/export/commands.yml)
